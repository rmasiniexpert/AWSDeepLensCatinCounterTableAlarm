# AWS DeepLens Project
## Cat get out of my table!

I have 1 dog, 5 fishes and 3 cats. Yes an animal lover! My last 2 pets, Misty(gray very smart cat) and Spark(a cuddely and lovely kitten) start to create me some problems. After we bought some bar stools they found out that they could reach the countertop and search for small peices of food on the sink. 
To solve this problem I decide to design Deep learning solution that every time that recognize a cat, trigger a set of alarms!
For this project I will use:
1. DeepLens


## Setting up a DeepLens appliance

At this point I suppose that you have a DeepLens device(I bought mine on Facebook marketplace) and AWS account.
